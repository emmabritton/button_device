# Button Device

This project consists of a Rust library, 2 Rust desktop programs, circuit schematic and 3D models for a device with 4 buttons, 3 LEDs and a small screen that can be used with a computer.

## Technical details

The device communicates over the serial port/micro USB. It has three LEDS: green, blue and red; the blue LED is less bright than the other two. The display is 4x21 characters.
